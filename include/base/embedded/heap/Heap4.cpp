 * A sample implementation of pvPortMalloc() and vPortFree() that combines
 * (coalescences) adjacent memory blocks as they are freed, and in so doing
 * limits memory fragmentation.
 *
 * See heap_1.c, heap_2.c and heap_3.c for alternative implementations, and the
 * memory management pages of https://www.FreeRTOS.org for more information.
